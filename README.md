## Erratum
In the original publication [[1]](#ref), Fig. 4A, the "Mitochondria" heatmap (column 2) and the "Calcium" heatmap (column 3) got mistakenly swapped. It has been corrected in the Juypter Notebook [04.pathway.ipynb](Notebook/04.pathway.ipynb) (cell 29 and 30). Since Fig. 4A only serves visual introduction to section `S- and T-types differentially express inflammatory factors and regulators of intracellular calcium, mitochondrial function, and the epigenome`, and all Fig. 4 related discussion and conclusion are based on Fig. 4B (the barcharts) and Table [genesets.csv](https://github.com/kimpenn/astrotypes-analysis/blob/main/Data/genesets.csv), we confirm that this mistake does not affect any discussion or conclusion. However, we apologize for the mistake.
